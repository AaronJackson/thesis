In the ICCV paper:

A morphable model for the synthe- sis of 3d faces.

Large-pose face alignment via cnn- based dense 3d model fitting

A multiresolution 3d morphable face model and fitting framework

Estimating 3d shape and tex- ture using pixel intensity, edges,
specular highlights, texture constraints and a prior

Face alignment across large poses: A 3d solution. 2016

Joint face alignment and 3d face reconstruction




Volumetric 3D reconstruction done badly :) :
