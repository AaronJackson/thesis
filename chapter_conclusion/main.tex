\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

This thesis proposed a novel approach to 3D face reconstruction,
resilient to large pose, expressions and occlusion, which we have
called Volumetric Regression Networks. We also showed that the same
idea can be applied to other deformable objects, such as the entire
human body.
