  I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor, Georgios
  Tzimiropoulos, for his tireless encouragement, advice, guidance and
  support throughout my PhD. I would also like to thank the Computer
  Vision Laboratory as a whole for being a welcoming, friendly and
  supportive environment - in particular, B86: Dimitiros, Ioanna,
  Jing, Joy, Keerthy, Kike and Siyang. \\ [0.3em]

  \noindent I would also like to thank members of the
  \verb|#symbollox| IRC channel for their friendship and support,
  particularly through difficult times. \\ [0.3em]

  \noindent Finally, thank you to my parents (Charlotte \& Ian) for their
  enthusiasm to continuing my studies, and also not complaining
  \textit{too} much about lack of visits.
