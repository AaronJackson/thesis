  First and foremost, I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor,
  Georgios Tzimiropoulos, for his tireless encouragement, advice,
  guidance and support throughout my PhD. I would also like to thank
  the Computer Vision Laboratory as a whole for being a welcoming,
  friendly and supportive environment - in particular, B86: Dimitris,
  Ioanna, Jing, Joy, Keerthy, Kike and Siyang.

  \noindent I would also like to thank my friends over in
  \verb|symbollox| for keeping me entertained throughout the day, but
  also for their support in early 2018: \verb|j`ey|, \verb|mgsk|,
  \verb|mister_m|, \verb|moparisthebest|, \verb|penryu|, \verb|pie__|,
  \verb|qu1j0t3| and \verb|stylewarning|.

  \noindent Thank you to Joe, most importantly for being a friend I
  can talk to about anything, but also an excellent colleague who has
  always helped me. Also, thanks to my housemate and friend Tom,
  although I'm not \textit{really} sure what for -- just a bit of
  everything I guess.

  \noindent Finally, thank you to my mum (Charlotte), dad (Ian),
  brother (Wes) and sister (Nic), for their encouragement and support
  over the past few years.
