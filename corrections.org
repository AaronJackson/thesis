List of Corrections

- [X] Title: 3D human face and body reconstruction.
- [ ] Figure description of 3DMM is expected in the introduction
- [X] Page 13, clarify last sentence of first paragraph
- [X] Page 14, define X, Y, Z directions
- [X] Page 14, better clarify the process of “counting of line
  intersections”
- [ ] Page 16, if not in great detail, it is still desirable to
  describe a bit of history of deep learning methods and general
  architectures of CNN in section 2.2.
- [X] Page 20, clarify “mean shape of facial landmark”.
- [X] Page 21, define the term of incremental fitting.
- [X] Page 21, medium scale features
- [ ] Page 23, improve clarity of section 3.1.5
- [X] Page 24, a gentle introduction for human body reconstruction.
- [X] Page 25, clarify the sentence: “provided to these….”
- [ ] Page 32, be clear on the highly difficult.
- [ ] Page 34, more details of dataset (e.g vertices, image size,
  etc.) and
- [ ] Page 34, suggest to move the dataset description to a section
  later and combine with other datasets. Explicitly describe which one
  is for training and which one is for testing.
- [ ] Page 35, details about volumetric representation. How to fill
  holes in mouth?
- [ ] Page 36, justify why using 192x192x200
- [ ] Page 38, IMPORTANT: details of hourglass (number of feature
  channels, layers), and loss function for landmarks.
- [ ] Page 38-39: order of VRN-multitask and VRN-guided on page 39 is
  not consistent with figure 4.4.
- [ ] Page 39, add more details for Multitask and guided
  methods. (e.g.  Loss function, backpropagation, etc.)
- [ ] Page 40, justification of number of Epoch. Used validation
  dataset?
- [ ] Page 40, section 4.3, highly recommend moving the result section
  to a section after all the experiments and evaluation metrics are
  properly described. The audience currently need to go back and forth
  to follow the complete story.
- [ ] Page 43, add statistical tests of results to demonstrate
  statistical significance and report computational time for training
  and testing.
- [ ] Page 43, figure 4.6 need to be reference first before figure
  4.7.
- [ ] Page 45, figure 4.11, wrong order of first two images in row 1.
- [ ] Page 46, define 3D interocular distance.
- [ ] Page 47, details of the sequence of applying ICP and marching
  cube
- [ ] Page 48, mention metrics employed in the caption of table.
- [ ] Page 50, rewrite section 4.4 to improve clarity.
- [ ] Page 50, details of dataset (e.g. how many images/subjects per
  angle?)
- [ ] Page 51, how many subjects for each expression?
- [ ] Page 52, compare with other methods in large pose/ expression
  experiments
- [ ] Page 52, list results in a table for the ablation tests.
- [ ] Page 54, add computational time to table 4.3 and some comments
  regarding time.
- [ ] Page 55, justify why 1 stack Hourglass performed better but
  still use 2 stacked one?
- [ ] Page 56, rephase the title of 4.6.4
- [ ] Page 62, be more specific regarding optimisation methods (second
  paragraph)
- [ ] Page 65, define Z direction, add details of SMPLify.
- [ ] Page 66, define Z direction, head-foot direction?
- [ ] Page 66, section 5.2.3 how many images for training
- [ ] Page 67-69, don’t use “ours” in the title.
- [ ] Page 67, add details of multi-scale residual module and
- [ ] Page 68, how four losses are combined and optimised.
- [ ] Page 72, statistical test and how many testing images.
- [ ] Page 84, how many training images for each dataset
- [ ] Page 86-87, label equations, explain 32 stride.
- [ ] Page 88, move table 6.1 that close to Figure 6.4.
- [ ] Page 90, please clarify “huge”
- [ ] Page 92, more comments on connected landmark and guided by
  detected.
- [ ] Page 94, move figure 6.9 to page 92.
- [ ] Reference, use uniform style.


All minor typographic error and missing references are annotated in
the thesis with a green or pencil cross. Please avoid repetition of
certain sentences (e.g. page 31 last paragraph).

Generally, it is not a good practice to use reference as part of the
sentence (e.g. [10] suggests…). Instead you may use the author names
(e.g. Jackson et al. [10] suggest…).

Generally, keep figures and tables close to the relevant texts.
