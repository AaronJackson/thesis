List of Corrections


- [X] Title: 3D human face and body reconstruction.

- [X] Figure description of 3DMM is expected in the introduction
  - A figure has been added which gives an brief overview of the steps
    to fit a 3DMM.

- [X] Page 13, clarify last sentence of first paragraph

- [X] Page 14, define X, Y, Z directions

- [X] Page 14, better clarify the process of “counting of line
  intersections”

- [X] Page 16, if not in great detail, it is still desirable to
  describe a bit of history of deep learning methods and general
  architectures of CNN in section 2.2.
  - I have given a gentle introduction to deep learning, convolutions
    and batch norm as the first section of the background chapter.

- [X] Page 20, clarify “mean shape of facial landmark”.

- [X] Page 21, define the term of incremental fitting.

- [X] Page 21, medium scale features

- [X] Page 23, improve clarity of section 3.1.5
  - I've given a bit more background to depth estimation.

- [X] Page 24, a gentle introduction for human body reconstruction.

- [X] Page 25, clarify the sentence: “provided to these….”

- [X] Page 32, be clear on the highly difficult.

- [X] Page 34, more details of dataset (e.g vertices, image size,
  etc.) and
  - Added some explanation about both the number of vertices and the
    image size. I already feel that we explain the artificially warped
    faces fairly well in this section.

- [X] Page 34, suggest to move the dataset description to a section
  later and combine with other datasets. Explicitly describe which one
  is for training and which one is for testing.
  - I'm not really sure how I can structure this better. The datasets
    we use for evaluation are described under the results section, and
    I think like this makes a lot of sense.  The training datasets are
    described in a section under Method. I've changed the titles to
    "Training Datasets" and "Evaluation Datasets". Perhaps this is
    less confusing?

- [X] Page 35, details about volumetric representation. How to fill
  holes in mouth?
  - I have added some explanation about how our voxelisation was
    performed, contrary to the "standard approaches", and why this
    results in the mouth being filled in.

- [X] Page 36, justify why using 192x192x200
  - I have explained the choice in 192x192, and also why the depth is 200.

- [X] Page 38, IMPORTANT: details of hourglass (number of feature
  channels, layers), and loss function for landmarks.
  - I have covered this with the stuff for "Page 39 add more details
    for Multitask and guided method"

- [X] Page 38-39: order of VRN-multitask and VRN-guided on page 39 is
  not consistent with figure 4.4.
  - I have corrected the ordering of the subfigures.

- [X] Page 39, add more details for Multitask and guided
  methods. (e.g.  Loss function, backpropagation, etc.)
  - I have explained that the loss is summed in both of these cases,
    and stated that the same loss is used for both volumetric
    regression and landmark localisation.

- [X] Page 40, justification of number of Epoch. Used validation
  dataset?
  - Explained the training protocol remained fixed for all
    experiments. The number of epochs for each stage was decided upon
    from the beginning by training (the unguided) VRN and monitoring
    the loss, in addition to some validation experiments on the
    testing section of HELEN images.

- [X] Page 40, section 4.3, highly recommend moving the result section
  to a section after all the experiments and evaluation metrics are
  properly described. The audience currently need to go back and forth
  to follow the complete story.
  - I have updated this and believe it is now easier to follow.

- [X] Page 43, add statistical tests of results to demonstrate
  statistical significance and report computational time for training
  and testing.
  - [X] I have included p-values for a paired t-test, showing whether
    the tests were significant for conclusions 1 (comparing with other
    methods) and 4 (comparing guided to multitask).
  - [X] I have included a subsection on runtimes for training and
    inference.

- [X] Page 43, figure 4.6 need to be reference first before figure
  4.7.
  - I have corrected the ordering of these. 4.6 became 4.9

- [X] Page 45, figure 4.11, wrong order of first two images in row 1.
  - I have corrected this.

- [X] Page 46, define 3D interocular distance.
  - I have explained what this is and also stated that it remains
    fixed as the face is rotated.

- [X] Page 47, details of the sequence of applying ICP and marching
  cube

- [X] Page 48, mention metrics employed in the caption of table.
  - Not sure I understand. The caption already gives the metric
    normalized mean error (NME) is used. I have referenced the NME
    equation in each case.

- [X] Page 50, rewrite section 4.4 to improve clarity.

- [X] Page 50, details of dataset (e.g. how many images/subjects per
  angle?)
  - I have listed the pitches and yaws used, plus stated the number of
    subjects in Florence.

- [X] Page 51, how many subjects for each expression?

- [ ]  Page 52, compare with other methods in large pose/ expression
  experiments
  - As discussed, this will require a significant investment in time.

- [ ] Page 52, list results in a table for the ablation tests.
  - A table may not be the most appropriate format for these results
    as there are no comparisons with other methods (as mentioned below
    the previous correction). Each table would only have one row of
    results.

- [X] Page 54, add computational time to table 4.3 and some comments
  regarding time.
  - This ended up being done in a separate subsection (as mentioned in
    an earlier correction) entitled "Training and Run Times"

- [X] Page 55, justify why 1 stack Hourglass performed better but
  still use 2 stacked one?
  - I have explained that this may further support that increasing the
    number of modules is more optimal than increasing the number of
    stacked hourglasses. I've also updated the text to make it clear
    that the performance difference between all architectures is quite
    small.

- [X] Page 56, rephase the title of 4.6.4
  - I have changed this to "A Volumetric Implementation"

- [X] Page 62, be more specific regarding optimisation methods (second
  paragraph)

- [X] Page 65, define Z direction, add details of SMPLify.

- [X] Page 66, define Z direction, head-foot direction?
  - I have explained that the width and height match up with the X & Y
    of the volume respectively. The new dimensions Z is introduced as
    we are going from 2D -> 3D.

- [X] Page 66, section 5.2.3 how many images for training

- [X] Page 67-69, don’t use “ours” in the title.

- [X] Page 67, add details of multi-scale residual module and

- [X] Page 68, how four losses are combined and optimised.

- [X] Page 72, statistical test and how many testing images.

- [X] Page 84, how many training images for each dataset

- [X] Page 86-87, label equations, explain 32 stride.

- [X] Page 88, move table 6.1 that close to Figure 6.4.

- [X] Page 90, please clarify “huge”

- [X] Page 92, more comments on connected landmark and guided by
  detected.

- [X] Page 94, move figure 6.9 to page 92.

- [X] Reference, use uniform style.
  - While the style was consistent, many of the journal or conference
    names were inconsistent in my BibTeX fie. Additionally, details
    were missing from many of the bibliography entries. I have gone
    through these to ensure they are all correct and consistent. There
    are of course still variations between articles, in proceedings
    and technical reports, as defined by the IEEE referencing style.

- [X] All minor typographic error and missing references are annotated
  in the thesis with a green or pencil cross. Please avoid repetition
  of certain sentences (e.g. page 31 last paragraph).

- [X] Generally, it is not a good practice to use reference as part of
  the sentence (e.g. [10] suggests…). Instead you may use the author
  names (e.g. Jackson et al. [10] suggest…).
  - I have corrected these where I feel it helps with the sentence
    structure.
