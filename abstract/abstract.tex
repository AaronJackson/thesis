  3D Face reconstruction is the process of estimating the full 3D
  geometry of a human's face from one or more images. Applications of
  3D face reconstruction span a very wide area, from personalisation
  of video games and trying on accessories online, to measuring
  emotion arousal for psychological studies and in medicine, such as
  simulating the result of reconstructive surgery. Approaches 3D face
  reconstruction generally depend on a 3D Morphable Model - a
  parametric model, where the shape, pose and expression can be
  adjusted using a small number of parameters. While methods based on
  such techniques can work well on frontal images, they often begin to
  fail on large poses, difficult expression, occlusion, or bad
  lighting. Additionally, encoding detail in such a small number of
  parameters is not possible.

  In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to the problem of 3D
  face reconstruction: \textit{Volumetric Regression Networks}. Our
  approach constrains the problem to a the spatial domain using an
  end-to-end network which directly regresses the 3D geometry using a
  volumetric representation. We demonstrate that doing so can not only
  provide state-of-the-art results, but also be adapted to other
  deformable objects, such as the full human body.
