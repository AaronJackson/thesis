\chapter{Introduction}

The landscape of Computer Vision has shifted dramatically over the
past decade. Prior to this, general purpose solutions to difficult
problems had low success rates on unconstrained images. This thesis
primarily focuses on 3D face reconstruction, which is to estimate the
3D geometry of a face from a one or more images. This problem
inherently demands reliability on ``in-the-wild'' images. Such images
pose many challenges, such as large variations in pose, expression and
lighting, as well as self occlusion. In this introductory chapter, we
will briefly discuss several general approaches to 3D face
reconstruction, including their advantages and disadvantages. The aim
of doing this is to show where, how and why, our own work fits into
challenging space.
