\chapter{Introduction}

The landscape of Computer Vision has shifted dramatically over the
past decade. Prior to this, general purpose solutions to difficult
problems had low success rates on unconstrained images. An example
relevant to this thesis would be 3D face reconstruction, which
inherently demands reliability on ``in-the-wild'' images. These images
require the ability to handle large variations in pose, expression and
lighting, as well as self occlusion.
