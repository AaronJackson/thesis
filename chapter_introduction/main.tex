\chapter{Introduction}

The landscape of Computer Vision has shifted dramatically over the
past decade. Prior to this, general purpose solutions to difficult
problems had low success rates on unconstrained images. This thesis
primarily focuses on 3D face reconstruction, which is to estimate the
3D geometry of a face from a one or more images. This problem
inherently demands reliability on ``in-the-wild'' images. Such images
pose many challenges, such as large variations in pose, expression and
lighting, as well as self occlusion. In this introductory chapter, we
will briefly discuss several general approaches to 3D face
reconstruction, including their advantages and disadvantages. The aim
of doing this is to show where, how and why, our own work fits into
challenging space.

\paragraph{Thesis Outline} This thesis is structured as follows: In
Chapter~\ref{chapter:background} an introduction is given to the
various topics which our works depends on. This includes Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and 3D volumes, along with how they are
generated via voxelisation. Following on from this is a literature
review of related work in Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature}. Our first
work, which focuses on the problem of 3D face reconstruction is
explained in Chapter~\ref{chapter:face}. An extension to this work,
performing 3D reconstruction of the full human body, is presented in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:human}. While seemingly unrelated to the primary
focus of the thesis, our preliminary work on semantic facial part
labelling, which heavily influenced our approach to 3D reconstruction,
is described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:seg}.
