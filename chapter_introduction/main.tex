\chapter{Introduction}

The landscape of Computer Vision has shifted dramatically over the
past decade. Prior to this, general purpose solutions to difficult
problems had low success rates on unconstrained images. An example
relevant to this thesis is 3D face reconstruction, which inherently
demands reliability on ``in-the-wild'' images. These images pose many
challenges, such as large variations in pose, expression and lighting,
as well as self occlusion.
